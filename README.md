## Testbed project for Scala Swagger generation

jam is **an experimental, pre-alpha** library intented to generate a fully compliant [Swagger (OpenAPI) v3.2](https://swagger.io/specification/) file for your API documentation.

This project goals are:

- Offer a native Scala library for Swagger generation, given that the Scala ecosystem has very few options for achieving this purpose. Some of those projects are abandoned nowadays.
- Offer a syntax that doesn't muddle your code.
- Reflection-free. 
- Annotation-free.

## Releases

We're working harder to offer a first _alpha-grade_ distribution of this library aimed to support Scala 2.11.x/2.12.x/2.13.x versions. In the meantime, consider this project **under active development, non-production ready and experimental**.

## Contributions

Contributions are very welcome! At this time, we're working on shaping the DSL definition for this library, so feel free to send your PR if you want to collaborate.
